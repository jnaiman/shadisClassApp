# Info:
This is the "prep" notebook for a introductory Streamlit app for IS445.

## How to teach with this:
We will build this "from scratch" during class using the following steps:
1. Make sure your repo is cloned in your PraireLearn (this will be "is445_demo2" with my setup, "is445_demo" for each of the students)
1. Update the README.md if the app.py file has changed names
1. Copy what we did from last week to the app.py file here
1. Update the requirements.txt file to include libraries (see whats in here now)
