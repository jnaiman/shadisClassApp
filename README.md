# Install what you need for this notebook

It is recommended you install into a conda environment:

```
conda create -n DataVizOct python=3.10
```

Then you can install the correct packages.  If you have downloaded the requirements document you can install directly with:

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

Or you can install one by one with:

```
pip install streamlit==1.39.0 altair numpy pandas matplotlib
```

To work with the VSCode interface, be sure that `jupyter` is also installed:

```
pip install jupyter
```
 
Or you can install with `conda`.

Note that the package [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that we will be working with requires we use Python scripts, so JupyterLab and/or Jupyter Notebooks won't work for this process.
